# serverless-schmerverless
ETE 2020 talk surveying CF, SAM, Serverless and Architect. Hopefully...

This is the repository for my ETE talk, Serverless Schmerverless.

My goal is to try to understand Serverless from the beginner's perspective. This name was coined in 
late December when I was switching my focus over to investigating Serverless frameworks. The last project
I worked on was an AWS Docker-based platform, and I loved it. Running everything locally, but deploying 
the same stack to the cloud, using RDS for the database, and even using the same
Cognito based authentication made it easy to get things done.

So enter Serverless. Much more low-level, much more configuration than code, and bewildering.

This is my attempt to learn enough to share to others who are starting out, and to level up myself and people on our team quickly.
Given our goal of sharing what we've learned, I hope it helps you too.

Still not quite done here:

* Testing, Architect code integrating with React app. Will update it as I go along.
* Examples of AWS Event integration like notifications from bucket changes, etc. are a strength of Serverless. Need some of that.
* Integration with the RDS Proxy might be a good sample.

See our Github repo of AWS Samples https://github.com/chariotsolutions/aws-examples and visit our blog at
https://chariotsolutions.com/blog for lots of information on things we study around Serverless, Docker,
AWS, and much more.
